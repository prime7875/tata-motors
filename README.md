Unsupervised Learning on TATA MOTORS Share


Introduction

  Welcome to the "Unsupervised Learning on TATA MOTORS Share" project! This project aims to apply unsupervised learning techniques to analyze the historical stock data of TATA MOTORS and gain insights into its behavior and patterns. By utilizing unsupervised learning algorithms, we can uncover hidden structures and trends within the stock price movement, clustering similar patterns, and exploring relationships between different trading sessions.



Objective

The primary objective of this project is to use unsupervised learning algorithms to:

1. To apply the unsupervised machine learning to TATA MOTORS stock

Methodology

1. Data Collection: Gathered historical TATA MOTORS stock price data from reliable sources 
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis, and ensuring consistency, and spliting the data.
3. Unsupervised Learning: Applied various unsupervised learning algorithms, including but not limited to DQN and DDQN
4. Analysis and Visualization: Interpreted the results obtained from the unsupervised learning algorithms and visualized them using plots and charts.
