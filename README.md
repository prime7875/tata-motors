## Introduction
Welcome to the "Reinforcement Learning on TATA MOTORS Share" project! This project aims to apply Reinforcement learning techniques to analyze the historical stock data of TATA MOTORS and gain insights into its behavior and patterns. By utilizing Reinforcement learning algorithms, we can uncover hidden structures and trends within the stock price movement, clustering similar patterns, and exploring relationships between different trading sessions.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to use Reinforcement learning algorithms to:
- Apply unsupervised machine learning on TATA MOTORS stock.

## Methodology
To achieve the objectives mentioned above, we employed the following steps:
1. Data Collection: Gathered historical TATA MOTORS stock price data from reliable sources.
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis, and ensuring consistency.
3. Reinforcement Learning: Applied various Reinforcement learning algorithms, including but not limited to:
    - DQN
    - Double DQN
4. Analysis and Visualization: Interpreted the results obtained from the Reinforcement learning algorithms and visualized them using plots.

## Prerequisites
Before running the code or using this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- Python (3.7 and above)
- Python libraries: NumPy, Pandas, chainer, time, subprocess, plotly, copy, warnings (install using `pip install library_name`)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using: git clone https://github.com/prime7875/tata-motors.git
2. Install the required Python libraries: pip install library_name


## Results
Here are some sample results obtained from the analysis:

| Trade | Volume Change (%) | Volume | Price Change (%) | Returns (%) | Risk  |
|-------|-------------------|--------|------------------|-------------|-------|
| 5     | 0.49              | 710    | -20.6            | 9.646       | 3.131 |
| 10    | 0.10              | 1420   | -5.2             | 32.719      | 5.084 |
